# HEY! I am Aakifur.

I am a **programmer**, I ❤ to solve problems and create new things.

I have some open source projects 📕 in my github, you can try those and if it helps you in any way don't forget to star it 😁.


One of my open source projects is [Express-REST](https://github.com/AakifurRahman/express-rest-framework) to which I dedicate most of my time, don't forget to have a look at it, maybe it might help you in your next project.

And of course if you want to be part of any of my projects go ahead and contribute, help me make the projects even better.
